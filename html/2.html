    <hr class="h-4 w-100" />
    <p class="pt-small">The field of medicine is changing, and there&rsquo;s an alarming trend of more and more doctors living from paycheck to paycheck, never getting to the point where they can truly live life in the sweet spot. While it&rsquo;s true that there are a lot of contributing factors that are out of your control, like insurance, government regulations, and the rising cost of medical school, there&rsquo;s plenty that&rsquo;s in your control as well.</p>
    <p>You see, getting and staying financially healthy is a lot like getting and staying physically healthy. There are a million so-called experts out there touting magic formulas and shortcuts that sound great, but often end up doing more harm than good. If you can tune out the noise, though, and listen to the right people, there are some incredibly effective and innovative things you can do to get the results you want.</p>
    <p>Here at GenFi, we work with physicians every day to help them understand their financial risks and opportunities so they can make wise decisions that benefit themselves, their practices, and their families. We don&rsquo;t sell magic pills, and we don&rsquo;t just look at one piece of the puzzle either. We look at the big picture, all the way from medical school to retirement, and give our clients the right tools and information they need to set and achieve their financial goals.</p>
    <p>Much like you&rsquo;re held to the standards of the Hippocratic Oath, we hold ourselves to the highest standards to put your best interests ahead of our own, and we take our responsibility very seriously. No matter what your current financial situation is or what standard of living you want to achieve, maintain, and protect, we&rsquo;re here to arm you with everything you need to get the job done. All you have to do is take the first step.</p>
