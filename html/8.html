  "name": "Wesley Brugh, RICP<sup>&reg;</sup>",
  "position": "Partner",
  "bio": "<p>Through a comprehensive and thought out process, I strive to understand my clients&#39; current situation, determine where they would like to be in the years to come, and then map out a plan to help them get there. I recognize that not all clients are alike, so I enjoy taking a custom-tailored approach to planning for each person. Whether my clients are balancing their work and home life or managing their &ldquo;every day is a Saturday&rdquo; retirement schedule, I know they stay extremely busy. Sit back and enjoy doing what you do best and leave the financial matters to me. I&rsquo;d be honored to be your personal &ldquo;CFO&rdquo;.</p><p>Before joining the finance world, I graduated from Old Dominion University&#39;s Darden College of Education, where I majored in Career and Technical Education with a concentration in Marketing and Finance. After graduating in 2013 and before becoming a Financial Advisor in 2014, I had a brief stent in education at Hidden Valley High School in Roanoke, VA where I also coached basketball for five years. I&rsquo;m a firm believer in taking an educative based approach when working with clients and my education background allows me to effectively communicate the ideas and concepts associated with financial planning.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been married to Jordan since 2012 and have two beautiful children (Parker: 8, Beckett: 6). We have two adopted rescue dogs, Kaymen and Keera. When I&rsquo;m not working, I enjoy spending time with my family, playing sports, or coaching my children in whatever they are playing at the time.</p>"
