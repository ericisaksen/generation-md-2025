    <p>As a physician, you've likely been laser-focused on building your career and saving for retirement. But have you considered what happens when it's time to start withdrawing from those hard-earned savings? Enter the Qualified Longevity Annuity Contract, or QLAC &ndash; a little-known but potentially powerful tool that could revolutionize your retirement strategy.</p>
    <h3>What is a QLAC?</h3>
    <p>A QLAC is a type of deferred income annuity that's purchased with funds from a qualified retirement plan or IRA. It's designed to provide guaranteed income later in life, typically starting at age 85. But here's the kicker: the money you put into a QLAC isn't included in your Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) calculations until the annuity payments begin.</p>
    <h3>The RMD Dilemma</h3>
    <p>Now, you might be thinking, "RMDs? That's a problem for future me." But trust me, it's an issue you'll want to address sooner rather than later. Here's why:</p>
    <p>As of 2023, once you hit age 73 (thanks to the SECURE 2.0 Act), the government <u>requires</u> you to start withdrawing a specific percentage of your retirement accounts each year &ndash; whether you need the money or not. And let me tell you, these withdrawals can be substantial.</p>
    <p>I recently spoke with a physician whose mother is 74. She told me, "My mom hates pulling money out of her 401(k) because every dollar is taxed. She wishes she didn't have to take these RMDs. She doesn&rsquo;t even need them, but now she has to pay the taxes on them."</p>
    <h3>The Tax Time Bomb</h3>
    <p>Here's a hard truth many physicians don't want to hear: that pre-tax 401(k) you've been contributing to for years?<strong> It's not a tax-saving account; it's a tax-deferring account</strong>. You're not avoiding taxes; you're pushing them down the road. And with the U.S. government $36 trillion in debt, who knows what tax rates will look like in the future?</p>
    <p>In a pre-tax 401(k), you are being taxed on the harvest, as opposed to the seed. Just keep that in mind&mdash;because it could be a bumper crop.</p>
    <h3>Enter the QLAC</h3>
    <p>This is where QLACs shine. As of 2023, you can use up to $200,000 of your retirement savings to purchase a QLAC. This effectively removes that money from your RMD calculations until age 85, providing several benefits:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Lower RMDs: By reducing the balance used to calculate your RMDs, you can potentially lower your taxable income in the early years of retirement.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
    <li>Tax Management: QLACs give you more control over when you receive (and pay taxes on) a portion of your retirement income.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
    <li>Longevity Insurance: A QLAC provides guaranteed income late in life, helping to ensure you don't outlive your savings.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
    <li>Spending Confidence: Knowing you have guaranteed income starting at 85 can give you the confidence to spend more freely in your early retirement years.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>A Real-World Example</h3>
    <p>Let's say Dr. Smith has $2 million in her 401(k) at age 73. Without a QLAC, her first year's RMD would be about $80,000. But if she puts $200,000 into a QLAC, her RMD is now based on $1.8 million, reducing her first-year RMD to about $72,000. That's $8,000 less in taxable income for that year.</p>
    <p>Fast forward to when Dr. Smith is 85. Let's say her QLAC now provides $30,000 a year in guaranteed income. This income gives her the freedom to be more aggressive with her other investments or spend more freely on travel and hobbies, knowing she has this income safety net.</p>
    <h3>The Psychological Factor</h3>
    <p>One often overlooked benefit of QLACs is the peace of mind they can provide. If you know you're going to get a certain amount of money at age 85, it gives you "permission and bravery" to spend more money from 65 to 85 because you know this whole other pension is going to kick in.</p>
    <p>This psychological benefit shouldn't be underestimated. Many retirees, even those with substantial savings, are hesitant to spend in retirement for fear of running out of money. A QLAC can help alleviate this fear.</p>
    <p>Not only that, but there is a well-established understanding from the academic research that retirees who receive a guaranteed fixed income every month are both happier and even live longer.</p>
