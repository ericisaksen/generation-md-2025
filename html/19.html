    <p>As a financial advisor who specializes in helping physicians build long-term wealth, I often get asked about the best retirement plans for independent contractors.</p>
    <p>It's a great question, and the answer isn't always straightforward. Below, we&rsquo;re going to dive into three popular options: SEP IRAs, Solo 401(k)s, and Defined Benefit plans. Each has its pros and cons, and the right choice depends on your specific situation. So, let's break it down and see which might be the best fit for you.</p>
    <h3>SEP IRA: The Simple Solution</h3>
    <p>Let's start with the Simplified Employee Pension Individual Retirement Account, or <a href="https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-sponsor/simplified-employee-pension-plan-sep" target="_blank">SEP IRA</a>. As the name suggests, this is often the go-to choice for its simplicity. It's easy to set up, inexpensive to maintain, and straightforward to administer. If you're just starting out as an independent contractor or you're looking for a no-fuss option, a SEP IRA might be right up your alley.</p>
    <p>Here's the deal with SEP IRAs: you can contribute up to 25% of your net earnings from self-employment, with a maximum limit of $69,000 for 2024. That's a decent chunk of change you can stash away tax-deferred.</p>
    <p>But here's where it gets interesting (and potentially limiting): most 1099s physicians create an LLC (taxed like an S corp) and pay themselves a W-2. The 25% mentioned above is based on your W-2 income. So if you're strategically keeping your W-2 income low to save on payroll taxes (which is a smart move for many independent contractors), you're also limiting how much you can contribute to your SEP IRA.</p>
    <p>Let's say you're earning $400,000 a year, but you're only taking $100,000 as W-2 income to minimize your Social Security and Medicare taxes. In this case, your maximum SEP IRA contribution would be $25,000 (25% of $100,000). Not bad, but we can do better.</p>
    <p>Oh, and here's some breaking news for 2024: you can now do a Roth SEP IRA. This means you can make after-tax contributions that will grow tax-free and can be accessed income-tax-free in retirement. This is a big deal!</p>
    <h3>Solo 401(k): The Flexible Powerhouse</h3>
    <p>Now, let's talk about what we at GenFi consider the go-to choice for most independent contractor physicians: the Solo 401(k). It's a bit more complex than a SEP IRA, but the extra effort can really pay off.</p>
    <p>Solo 401(k)s allow you to wear two hats&mdash;employee and employer. As an employee, you can contribute up to $23,000 in 2024 (or $30,500 if you're 50 or older). Then, as the employer, you can add up to 25% of your compensation.</p>
    <p>Let's use the same example as before: you're earning $400,000 and paying yourself $100,000 in W-2 wages. With a Solo 401(k), you could contribute $23,000 as an employee, plus another $25,000 as the employer (25% of $100,000), for a total of $48,000. That's nearly double what you could put into a SEP IRA with the same income setup.</p>
    <p>Now, you might be wondering, "Can't I just increase my W-2 income to max out my contributions?" Well, you could, but it might not be the best move. To max out a Solo 401(k) at $69,000, you'd need to pay yourself about $184,000 in W-2 wages. But here's the issue: doing that would increase your Social Security and Medicare taxes by almost $10,000 a year. Is it worth paying an extra $10,000 in taxes just to defer an additional $21,000 into your retirement account? In most cases, probably not.</p>
    <p>Remember, you're not avoiding taxes with these contributions, you're just deferring them. On the other hand, the money you save on payroll taxes by keeping your W-2 income lower is money you save immediately and permanently.</p>
    <p>And for what it&rsquo;s worth, we&rsquo;re not saying don&rsquo;t save the extra $21,000.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d love for you to save it elsewhere, just not on the 401k if it means increasing your payroll tax.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Defined Benefit Plan: The Heavy Hitter</h3>
    <p>Now, let's talk about the big gun: the Defined Benefit plan. This is essentially a self-funded pension plan. It&rsquo;s not for everyone, but it can be a game-changer for high-earning physicians who are a bit older and looking to catch up on their retirement savings.</p>
    <p>Here's how it works: you tell the IRS how much you want to receive annually in retirement, and an actuary calculates how much you need to contribute each year to make that happen. These contribution limits can be massive. I'm talking potentially $150,000 to $200,000 per year for physicians in their late 40s or early 50s.</p>
    <p>The primary advantage of a Defined Benefit plan is the ability to sock away a ton of money on a pre-tax basis. If you're in your peak earning years and want to maximize your tax-deferred savings, this could be your ticket.</p>
    <p>But (and it's a big but), Defined Benefit plans come with some serious considerations:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Complexity: You'll need to work with an actuary each year to determine your contribution amount. It's not a set-it-and-forget-it kind of deal.</li>
    <li>Commitment: Once you set up a Defined Benefit plan, you're expected to fund it consistently. This isn't something you can easily skip in a lean year.</li>
    <li>Cost: With the increased complexity comes increased costs for administration and compliance.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>That said, for the right physician, a Defined Benefit plan can be incredibly powerful. It's particularly useful in two scenarios: First, you can actually utilize a Defined Benefit plan on its own or combine it with a Solo 401(k). This allows you to supercharge your savings without increasing your salary or payroll taxes.</p>
    <p>Second, if you're a high earner making $500,000 or more, a Defined Benefit plan can help you qualify for the Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction. The QBI deduction phases out for incomes over $384,000 (for married couples filing jointly in 2024). By using a Defined Benefit plan to reduce your taxable income, you might be able to squeeze under that limit and claim this valuable deduction.</p>
    <h3>Real-World Example: A Case Study</h3>
    <p>Let's bring all of this to life with a real-world example.</p>
    <p>Meet Dr. Smith, a 48-year-old independent contractor physician in Georgia. She's married, filing jointly, and her spouse earns $100,000 through W-2 employment. Dr. Smith earns $400,000 annually through 1099 income and has about $10,000 in deductible business expenses. Let's look at three different scenarios and see how they play out financially.</p>
    <p><strong>Scenario 1: The Simple Approach (SEP IRA)</strong></p>
    <p>In this scenario, Dr. Smith operates as a sole proprietor, receiving her 1099 income directly and filing a Schedule C. She maxes out a SEP IRA with a $69,000 contribution. Here's how the numbers shake out:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Federal tax: $61,699</li>
    <li>Self-employment tax: $31,351</li>
    <li>Medicare surcharge: $1,891</li>
    <li>Georgia state taxes: $20,935</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Total tax bill: $115,876</p>
    <p>This approach is straightforward but comes with a hefty self-employment tax.</p>
    <p><strong>Scenario 2: The Strategic Approach (LLC with S-Corp Election and Defined Benefit Plan)</strong></p>
    <p>Now, let's see what happens when Dr. Smith forms an LLC, elects to be taxed as an S-Corp, pays herself a $100,000 salary, and contributes $69,000 to a Defined Benefit plan:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Federal tax: $65,787</li>
    <li>Payroll tax: $15,300</li>
    <li>Georgia state taxes: $21,396</li>
    <li>LLC tax return, payroll, and Defined Benefit plan administration: $3,500</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Total costs: $105,983</p>
    <p>This approach saves Dr. Smith $9,893 per year compared to Scenario 1. That's nearly $10,000 back in her pocket annually!</p>
    <p><strong>Scenario 3: The Overzealous Approach (LLC with S-Corp Election and Maxed-Out Solo 401(k))</strong></p>
    <p>In this scenario, Dr. Smith forms an LLC taxed as an S-Corp but increases her salary to $184,000 to max out a Solo 401(k) at $69,000. Let's see how it plays out:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Federal tax: $69,714</li>
    <li>Payroll tax: $26,242</li>
    <li>Medicare surcharge: $306</li>
    <li>Georgia state taxes: $21,087</li>
    <li>LLC tax return, payroll, and 401(k) administration: $2,000</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Total costs: $119,349</p>
    <p>Surprisingly, this approach actually costs Dr. Smith $3,473 more than Scenario 1 and a whopping $13,366 more than Scenario 2. (The main culprit is the extra $10,000 or so in payroll taxes due to the higher salary).</p>
    <p><u>What Can We Learn From This?</u></p>
    <ol>
    <li>The power of structure: Setting up an LLC taxed as an S-Corp can lead to significant tax savings, but only if done correctly.</li>
    <li>Salary matters: Paying yourself a reasonable but lower salary as an S-Corp owner can result in substantial payroll tax savings.</li>
    <li>More isn't always better: Maxing out retirement contributions isn't always the best move if it requires increasing your salary and thus your payroll taxes.</li>
    <li>The value of good advice: The difference between the best and worst scenarios here is over $13,000 per year. Over a decade, that's $130,000 &ndash; and that's before we consider potential investment returns on those savings.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Remember, every physician's situation is unique. While this case study provides valuable insights, your optimal strategy may look different based on your specific circumstances, state of residence, income level, and long-term financial goals.</p>
    <h3>Choosing Your Path</h3>
    <p>So, which plan is right for you? As with most things in finance, it depends on your specific situation. Here's my general take:</p>
    <p>If you're just starting out or you value simplicity above all else, a SEP IRA might be your best bet. It's easy to set up and maintain, and it still allows for significant contributions.</p>
    <p>For most independent contractor physicians, I lean towards recommending a Solo 401(k). It offers more flexibility and higher contribution limits than a SEP IRA, without the complexity and commitment of a Defined Benefit plan.</p>
    <p>If you're older (say, in your late 40s or 50s), earning a high income, and looking to turbocharge your retirement savings, that's when I'd suggest considering a Defined Benefit plan, possibly in combination with a Solo 401(k).</p>
    <p>Remember, these retirement plans are powerful tools, but they're just one part of your overall financial picture. Your choice should align with your broader financial goals, tax situation, and long-term plans.</p>
    <p>As always, talk to a financial advisor who specializes in working with physicians before making any big decisions. We can help you crunch the numbers, consider all the angles, and choose the strategy that's best for you and your family.</p>
    <p>Building long-term wealth as a physician is a marathon, not a sprint. The right retirement plan can give you a significant head start, but it's your consistent effort and smart planning that will carry you across the finish line. Here's to your financial success!</p>
