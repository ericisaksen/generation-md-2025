  "name": "Daniel Burke, CFP<sup>&reg;</sup>, ChFC<sup>&reg;</sup>",
  "position": "Partner",
  "bio": "<p>In 2009, I completed my undergraduate degree in finance with my sights set on working in commercial real estate. The financial crisis of 2008/2009, however, had other plans for me and I was forced into exploring other career options.&nbsp; I decided to pursue the financial services industry directly out of college and am grateful I made that choice.&nbsp; After working with a Fortune 100 company for a few years, I was asked to become a Partner in their local office handling the development and management of new advisers.&nbsp; I remained in that role until August 2014, when I decided to move back into personal advising.</p><p>My specialty quickly became strategic planning with physicians around retirement and investments.&nbsp; My practice has grown rapidly and we continue to work with medical providers throughout the country. &nbsp;I have an amazing wife Liz, who is a Doctor of Nursing Practice from Vanderbilt University specializing in Psychiatry at our local VA Hospital.&nbsp; We had our son Hudson in April 2018 and he has only changed our lives for the better.&nbsp; Most of my free time is spent with family. If I can squeeze out some personal time, however, I enjoy local car shows and driving events in the Middle Tennessee area.</p>"
